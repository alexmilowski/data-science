3) How long did it take to run the process for each of these?

The local execution completed in 2m23.920s as indicated by the output of time:

real	2m23.920s
user	2m23.910s
sys	0m4.349s

The emr excution completed in 13m2.338s as indicated by the output of time:

real	13m2.338s
user	0m1.555s
sys	0m0.193s


4) How many address tags are there in the input?

The output of local and emr executions report 2042 "address" tags.


5) Does the local version and EMR version give the same answer?

The number of tags and their respective counts is consistent between the
output of both the the local and emr executions.  Differences exist between
the number of output files and the entries contained in each file.  When the
output files for each execution are concatenated and sorted there is no
difference in the resulting content.
