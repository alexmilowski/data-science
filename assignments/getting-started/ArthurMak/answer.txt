1. A copy of the output directory for the tag counter running locally (name the directory 'out').

See “out-local” directory that is also uploaded.
Please note that I merged the different parts into "parts-merged" file (used command "cat part-00000 part-00001 > parts-merged" ).

2. A copy of the output from S3 for the tag counter running on AWS (name the directory 'emr-out').

See “out-AWS” directory that is also uploaded.
I merged the different parts into "parts-merged" file.
