# EMR Examples #

* map-only - an example of how input splitting works
* prime-multiplier - an example of map/reduce key/value pairs that multiplies large numbers of integers via prime factorization.  Also demonstrates the difference between the output of analysis and representation of the results (e.g. prime factorization vs the actual decimal number)
